Installation of give and take
=============================

First, somehow edit the GIVE_SPOOL, GIVE_GRP, and GIVE_GID variables before
building. I'm not sure what the instructions for this are yet.

You also need to make sure the spool directory is created. How this is this
done you may ask? I don't know yet. :-)

Then, you can go ahead and build an RPM with the following commands:

$ git clone git@git.lanl.gov:filesystems/give.git give-3.0n-1
$ tar -zcf give-3.0n-1.tgz give-3.0n-1
$ rpmbuild -ta give-3.0n-1.tgz

Finally, you should validate proper operation and check it against your test
plan.
