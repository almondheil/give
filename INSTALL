INSTALLATION OF GIVE / TAKE
---------------------------

Because of varying requirements on different platforms, give/take is
distributed in source form only.  The following steps must be performed:

  1. Edit Makefile:
    - Verify / set correct values for the following:
       INSTALL_DIR  : directory where to install 'give' and 'take' binaries
       GIVE_SPOOL   : path where give will spool files until taken
       GIVE_GRP     : name of system group (usually bin) that owns GIVE_SPOOL
       GIVE_GID     : group ID corresponding to GIVE_GRP

    - Uncomment the correct option for CC (comment out the incorrect one)

    - On Tru64 machines, uncomment the following line:
       CFLAGS = -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

  2. Compile:
    - Type 'make'

  3. Install:
    - Type 'make install'
    - If spool directory does not already exist, run 'make create' to create it

  4. Validate proper operation and check testplan
