Description:
Giveng is a reimplementation of our give and take programs, with careful consideration of security in mind. 
A small suid give-assist program is used to remove all privilege from the "give" and "take" programs, 
which can now be implemented in any convienient language- even as shell scripts.

Depends on the string_m library for secure string manipulation.

give and take are a set of companion utilities that allow a
secure transfer of files from one user to another without exposing
the files to third parties.

The named files are copied to a spool area where they can be
retrieved by the user running the "take" program.  Ownership of the
files remains with the giver until they are taken, and will count
against any file system quotas imposed on the giver.

Certain users may be limited to take files only from specific
givers.  For these users, files may only be taken from givers
who are members of the gt-<uid> group where uid is the UNIX id
of the limited user. [NOTE: This is only implemented on LLNL's environment,
it SHOULD NOT bother you if you are a LANL user]

the current design is to: "give user file" or "take user file"

If you'd like detailed code documenatation access the html folder for doxygen generated docs, this will 
be useful for a general idea of what the code is doing...same comments are in the code itself.

see INSTALL file for configuration and installation instructions.
